# Network Intrusion Detection System

This project is a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that uses machine learning algorithms to detect various types of network intrusions. The system is built using Flask for the web interface and scikit-learn for the machine learning models. It classifies network traffic into Normal or one of several attack categories (DOS, PROBE, R2L, U2R).

## Features

- **Machine Learning Models**: Uses a pre-trained model (saved in `models/model.pkl`) to classify network traffic.
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly web interface (built with Flask and HTML/CSS) to input network features and view predictions.
- **Email Alerts**: Automatically sends email alerts when an intrusion (non-Normal traffic) is detected.
- **API Endpoint**: Provides a `/results` endpoint for programmatic access to predictions via JSON.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: The main Flask application file. Contains the web server logic, routing, and prediction handling.
- `models/`: Directory containing the trained machine learning model (`model.pkl`).
- `NSL_Dataset/`: Directory containing the training and testing datasets (`Train.txt`, `Test.txt`) used for model development.
- `static/`: Directory containing static files like CSS (`style.css`, `home_styles.css`).
- `templates/`: Directory containing HTML templates (`home.html`, `index.html`) for the web interface.
- `corrm.csv`: Correlation matrix CSV file, likely used during data analysis.
- `num_summary.csv`: Numerical summary CSV file of the dataset.
- `pandas_profiling.html`: HTML report generated by pandas profiling, offering a detailed analysis of the dataset.
- `Copy_of_Network_Intrusion_Detection_System.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/SudoAnirudh/Intrusion-Detection-System-Using-ML.git
    cd Intrusion-Detection-System-Using-ML
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *Note: Ensure you have `scikit-learn==0.22.1` installed as the model was pickled with this version.*

## Usage

1. **Configure Email Settings (Optional):**
   Open `app.py` and update the `EMAIL_ADDRESS` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` variables if you want to enable email alerts. You will also need to update the recipient list in the `predict` and `results` functions.

2. **Run the Flask application:**
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

3. **Access the Web Interface:**
    Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
    - Click on "Launch" or navigate to `/ids` to access the detection form.
    - Fill in the network parameters (e.g., connection count, service rates).
    - Click "Predict" to see if the traffic is Normal or an Attack.

4. **API Usage:**
   You can send a POST request to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/results` with a JSON body containing the feature values.

## Model Information

The model attempts to classify traffic into the following categories:
- **Normal**: Normal network traffic.
- **DOS**: Denial of Service attack.
- **PROBE**: Probing or surveillance activity.
- **R2L**: Remote to Local attack (unauthorized access from a remote machine).
- **U2R**: User to Root attack (unauthorized access to local superuser privileges).
