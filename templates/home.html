            <h2>What is an Intrusion?</h2>
            <p>An intrusion represents any unauthorized access or malicious activity targeting a computer system or network.  This compromises data integrity, confidentiality, and availability, leading to potential breaches and financial losses.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="types-of-intrusion" class="content-section">
            <h2>Types of Intrusions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Network-based Attacks:</strong>  These target network infrastructure, including Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, and unauthorized access attempts.</li>
                <li><strong>Host-based Attacks:</strong> These target individual systems directly, encompassing malware infections (viruses, ransomware), unauthorized access attempts (via brute-forcing or exploiting vulnerabilities), and data exfiltration.</li>
                <li><strong>Application-level Attacks:</strong> These exploit vulnerabilities within applications, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and buffer overflow attacks. </li>
                <li><strong>Physical Attacks:</strong>  Involve direct physical access to hardware, potentially leading to theft, data alteration, or system disruption. </li>
                <li><strong>Social Engineering:</strong>  These are non-technical attacks using deception to manipulate individuals into divulging sensitive information or granting access.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="how-ids-works" class="content-section">
            <h2>How Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) Work</h2>
            <p>An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) continuously monitors network traffic and system activities for suspicious patterns indicative of intrusions.  They employ various techniques, including signature-based detection (matching known attack patterns), anomaly-based detection (identifying deviations from normal behavior), and machine learning for advanced threat detection.  Upon detecting an intrusion, the IDS generates alerts, allowing security personnel to take timely action.</p>

        <section id="ml-in-ids" class="content-section">
            <h2>Machine Learning in IDS</h2>
            <p>Machine learning (ML) significantly enhances the capabilities of intrusion detection systems. ML algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to identify complex patterns and anomalies that might evade traditional signature-based methods.  This allows for the detection of zero-day attacks (previously unknown exploits) and improves the accuracy of detection while reducing false positives.</p>
