## 2026-01-08 - Adding Loading States to Synchronous Forms
**Learning:** Adding a visual loading state (spinner + disabled button) to a synchronous form submission significantly improves perceived performance and prevents double-submission.
**Action:** When implementing this pattern, ensure the loading state is triggered on the 'submit' event (which only fires if HTML5 validation passes) rather than the 'click' event, to avoid locking the UI on invalid forms. Also, remember that for standard page reloads, the state reset happens automatically when the new page loads.

## 2026-01-08 - Linking Descriptions with aria-describedby
**Learning:** Input fields often have helper text in `<span>` tags. These are invisible to screen readers unless programmatically linked.
**Action:** Always add `id` to the helper text span and `aria-describedby="[id]"` to the input field. This is a low-effort, high-impact accessibility win.

## 2026-01-08 - Validating Numeric Constraints
**Learning:** Backend models often have strict numeric ranges (e.g., last_flag 0-21) that cause crashes if violated. Users don't know these constraints without guidance.
**Action:** Always pair backend constraints with frontend attributes (`min`, `max`) and explicit helper text to prevent errors before they happen.
