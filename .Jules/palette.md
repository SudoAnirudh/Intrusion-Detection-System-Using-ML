## 2026-01-08 - Adding Loading States to Synchronous Forms
**Learning:** Adding a visual loading state (spinner + disabled button) to a synchronous form submission significantly improves perceived performance and prevents double-submission.
**Action:** When implementing this pattern, ensure the loading state is triggered on the 'submit' event (which only fires if HTML5 validation passes) rather than the 'click' event, to avoid locking the UI on invalid forms. Also, remember that for standard page reloads, the state reset happens automatically when the new page loads.

## 2026-01-08 - Linking Descriptions with aria-describedby
**Learning:** Input fields often have helper text in `<span>` tags. These are invisible to screen readers unless programmatically linked.
**Action:** Always add `id` to the helper text span and `aria-describedby="[id]"` to the input field. This is a low-effort, high-impact accessibility win.

## 2026-01-09 - Accessibility for Custom Toggle Buttons
**Learning:** Custom buttons acting as tabs or toggles (like "Manual" vs "Live") need explicit state communication. Visual class changes (colors/borders) are invisible to screen readers.
**Action:** Use `aria-pressed="true/false"` on the buttons and update these attributes in the same JavaScript function that handles the visual switching.
